A decision tree representation in HTML and Javascript (jQuery) based in a data science roadmap. The HTML page was developed using 3 main segments (the branches are an offshoot of the root node and represent different courses of action or options that are available to the decision-maker). For example, the root node is represented by the key word Machine Learning and subequent branches are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and so on.
The system outputs a text and examples belonging to each branch of the tree, for example a classification in supervised learning is used for email spam detection and speech recognition, as we can see as the output.
